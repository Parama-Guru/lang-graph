    "**A Structured Output Agent in LangChain (or other LLM frameworks) refers to an agent that produces responses in a specific structured format, such as JSON, dictionaries, or other structured data types. These agents are particularly useful when you want to ensure that your responses conform to a defined schema, making it easier to parse, validate, and utilize in downstream applications.**\n",

    "\n",
    "- Controlled Responses: Ensures that the outputs follow a specific format, reducing ambiguity.\n",
    "- Data Validation: Useful when you want the model output to fit predefined structures, like for APIs or database entries.\n",

As a result, during the Governorship of Elihu Yale (1687–92), the large number of British and European settlers led to the most important political event which was the formation of the institution of a mayor and the Corporation for the city of Madras. Because of its importance to the East India Company, the French plundered and destroyed the village of Chepauk and Blacktown, the locality across from the port where all the dockyard labourers used to live.[7]\\\\nThe British regained control in 1749 through the Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle. Therefore, because of the fort\\'s proximity or origin to the village of Mandraspatnam, and the fort\\'s centrality to the development of the city, the British settlers of the city later named their settlement Madras in honour of it.\"}, {\"url\": \"https://www.britannica.com/place/Chennai\", \"content\": \"Among the leading medical facilities in the city are the Apollo Hospital, the Madras Medical Mission’s Institute of Cardiovascular Diseases, the Sri Ramachandra University Hospital, the Heart Institute of Chennai, and the Sankara Nethralaya (“Temple of the Eye”), an ophthalmic hospital.\\\\n Other places of worship within the city include Luz Church (1547–82), one of the oldest churches in Chennai; St. Mary’s Church (1678–80), the first British church in India; the San Thome Basilica (1898), built over the tomb of the apostle St. Thomas; and Wallajah Mosque (1795), built by the nawab of Karnataka.
